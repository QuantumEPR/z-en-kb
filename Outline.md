# Introduction

1. Explain that the site is a digial mind garden
2. Loved the lifelong learning and multidisciplinary perspective of Honors
3. Knew I wanted to study CSE, didn't expect the difficulty/competition
4. Started off thinking college has less emphasis on GPA and would not terribly affect my chances into major
5. Decided to explore, and was very willing to take risks in unfamiliar and challenging courses
6. Got a great experience in the memoir writing; didn't knew that genuine recalling memory could be this rewarding
7. Show memoir
8. Tested my limitations on how much course load can I take
9. Worsening grades and attempting to balance between what's ideal and what's real

# Going Downhill

1. High hopes cut short
2. Still kept taking honors courses 
	1. Did not have a major
	2. Unsure of how to pursue CSE
	3. Fear of networking -> did no networking at all
3. Took LARCH because LARCH designs seemed interesting
	1. Knew that I was not serious and will not pursue LARCH as a career for sure
4. Numerous attempts in CSE + INFO + MATH + ACMS + HCDE and no admission
	1. Discouraging message from CSE advising: No chance for admission at all
5. Thought about alternative ways to pursue CSE without a CS degree
6. Been here in the US for years, always relied on myself
	1. Sought honors advising
	2. Pre-major extension
7. Found great Honors linguistic course to lighten the mood
8. Escaped into the wilderness

# Metamorphosis
1. Second pre-major extension - Final attempt at both Maths and Informatics
2. Became less afraid of rejection/failures
	1. Be at peace with myself - do what I can, try my best, and calmly accept the result
3. Performed well in MATH 309; INFO 498C opened up an opportunity to do research in the iSchool
4. Might as well try researching as it's always good to learn something
5. Social VR study 
	1. Hypothesize, Literature review, Surveying, and a ton of data analysis
	2. Realized that I would like to do research, but not in the social sciences
6. Suddenly got admitted to Maths, felt like my effort finally had some returns
7. Covid started

# The Rise
1. Had a doubt about whether I should attempt something interdisplinary with Maths
2. Somehow got admitted by Informatics, perhaps due to my effort in the research
3. INFO Capstone
	1. Worked in an amazing team of four for a sponsor
	2. Pushed me to take on responsibility as a developer and think critically about a product that would eventually deliver in the real world
	3. Main parts
		1. Preliminary research
		2. Ideation, Prototyping, Validation
		3. MVP development
		4. Dev Cycle I/II
		5. Final delivery
	4. A lot of perspective from previous design classes helped me think outside of the mindset of a developer and work with my team
	5. Delivery was not award winning but sharpened our skillsets nonetheless

# The Summit
1. Worked as a student assistant developer at CIP
2. Relax, and enjoy the classes
3. Persistence have made me stronger
