# Introduction

1. Talk about motivation.
2. My motivation for getting into Honors was my love of lifelong learning and combining disciplines.
3. Talk about academic goals.
4. My goal was admission to the UW computer science department.
5. I enjoy the logical reasoning in CS problems.
6. Giving instructions to machines and making them do marvel is fantastic.
7. Make them perform things that are potentially even better than human performance.
8. It's just fascinating to me.
9. I had high hopes, but I had many failures along the way.
10. These failures were partly due to the lack of a solid foundation and pushed me to take classes that I may not have experienced if I had not been pushed off my straight journey toward the CS degree. This portfolio showcases some of my failures and the surprising insights and successes that came toward the end of my time at UW when my time was running out.

My GPA was hit hard by the introductory classes. One of the major turning points was Matrix Algebra (show page with an image).

# Going Downhill

1. High hopes cut short
2. Still kept taking honors courses
   1. Did not have a major
   2. Unsure of how to pursue CSE
   3. Fear of networking -> did no networking at all
3. Took LARCH because LARCH designs seemed interesting
   1. Knew that I was not serious and will not pursue LARCH as a career for sure
4. Numerous attempts in CSE + INFO + MATH + ACMS + HCDE and no admission
   1. Discouraging message from CSE advising: No chance for admission at all
5. Thought about alternative ways to pursue CSE without a CS degree
6. Been here in the US for years, always relied on myself
   1. Sought honors advising
   2. Pre-major extension
7. Found great Honors linguistic course to lighten the mood
8. Escaped into the wilderness

# Metamorphosis

1. Second pre-major extension - Final attempt at both Maths and Informatics
2. Became less afraid of rejection/failures
   1. Be at peace with myself - do what I can, try my best, and calmly accept the result
3. Performed well in MATH 309; INFO 498C opened up an opportunity to do research in the iSchool
4. Might as well try researching as it's always good to learn something
5. Social VR study
   1. Hypothesize, Literature review, Surveying, and a ton of data analysis
   2. Realized that I would like to do research, but not in the social sciences
6. Suddenly got admitted to Maths, felt like my effort finally had some returns
7. Covid started

# The Rise

1. Had a doubt about whether I should attempt something interdisplinary with Maths
2. Somehow got admitted by Informatics, perhaps due to my effort in the research
3. INFO Capstone
   1. Worked in an amazing team of four for a sponsor
   2. Pushed me to take on responsibility as a developer and think critically about a product that would eventually deliver in the real world
   3. Main parts
      1. Preliminary research
      2. Ideation, Prototyping, Validation
      3. MVP development
      4. Dev Cycle I/II
      5. Final delivery
   4. A lot of perspective from previous design classes helped me think outside of the mindset of a developer and work with my team
   5. Delivery was not award winning but sharpened our skillsets nonetheless

# The Summit

1. Worked as a student assistant developer at CIP
2. Relax, and enjoy the classes
3. Persistence have made me stronger
