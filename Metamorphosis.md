I remember when I was in my first quarter at UW. I naively thought that college would be the stage where I shine. It turned out that I had to stumble through so many challenges and difficulties. Either due to luck or my undoing, the passion I began with almost fizzled out. I have grown, perhaps so much so that it felt immeasurable. Back in the day, I would go to badminton practices even I hadn't studied for the next days' exam. I would enroll in courses I find fun, regardless of branch of study. Landscape Architecture? Sounds fun! And then I would register for it without a second thought. But academic excellence does not come free, and this fact struck me hard in the face. The anxiety creeps up my shoulders, crawls into my ears, seeps into my mind. Where am I supposed to go, what am I lacking? 

I was on the brink of giving up, but I didn't. And the light finally came.
