# The Matrix: Failure

![Image here](../images/temp.jpg)
This is the first time I've failed so hard since the beginning of my undergraduate study. Terrible grade, probably the lowest in the class. I've went to all office hours, finished all homeworks on time and with fine grade, read through the textbook carefully, yet still screwed up the tests. What could've I done?
