# Thinking Numbers. Proving Statements

This is one of my proudest learning artifact. It is a token of my journey's beginning in Maths, and a redemption for my self-esteem. I used to do quite terribly at Maths, and I always wanted to show that I can be good at it. This course taught me the way to use Mathematics as a language; a langauge designed to express problems in a precise yet artful way. I also learned the Mathematician's Essential toolset, a series of proof methods for turning ill-posed problems into the ones we have solved.
