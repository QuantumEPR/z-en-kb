# Experiential Learning

## Social VR Researcher

For the first time, I got to be an active researcher in the UW Gamer Lab. As an amateur researcher, I had to say that this experience deviates from my initial expectations. Nevertheless, I have learned to adopt a new perspective to research.

What is the quirkiest feature of a new research project? The unpredictable shifts in focus and methodology. Most are minor, which occurs when literature reviews have not given us a credible foundation. Within the first week of the project, we migrated from analyzing coding programs to second language learning program due to the lack of supportive theories.

Furthermore, our methodology has also gone through revision. In the beginning, we were going to synthesize the Virtual Reality learning experience from the users using existing theories. I have taken leadership to propose and select a methodology of setting up workshops via both the VR platform and zoom meeting as a comparison study. Since zoom has been the de-facto choice for many higher education institutions during the COVID pandemic, it is an excellent approach to see if VR technology is more effective for language learning.

After re-aligning and solidifying our focus, we started several rounds of brainstorming on what measurements to conduct. We have eventually agreed upon assessing four critical aspects of analysis on participants: Motivation, Anxiety, Self-confidence, and Contextualization. It is never easy to decide on what to discard after a fruitful brainstorm session. However, there are always too many things we could measure. Research is about finding the few that matters.

It might seem that these steps are minuscule; they are indispensable. As a reminder, there have been countless attempts to use virtual environments as accessible learning facilities since the emergence of commercialized VR gears. To understand how the "immersion" within a social space in virtual reality affects second language learning, we must avoid introducing bias in research.

This project is still ongoing. A survey is a necessary part we need to ask participants to complete prior and after the workshops, and I am currently responsible for making the survey questions in UW WebQ, flyer design, and posting of recruit info. It had come a long way, and at this stage, the goal is to get IRB approval for our data collection procedure. I am optimistic about the progress; the rapid changes we have gone through are what intrinsically define information technology and draw me in. Being a researcher in this project is a breathtaking experience that prepares me as a researcher and as a more observant and decisive leader in my future learning.
