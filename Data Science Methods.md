# Time for a refresher

As an introductory course, INFO 370 allowed me to relax and have a refresher on what inference we can make from data. Before this course, I have lost track of how we used t-tests and different kinds of regression. Professor Toomet was a lovely instructor, and I was able to have many conversations with him. Props to him, I discovered CSE 446, a Machine Learning course that talks about ML with mathematical precision. Ott has also informed me of many exciting books in AI/ML that might help me pursue my academic goals (Computer Vision/Computer Graphics now). Feels great to have a quick refresher and get some mentorship in this course!
