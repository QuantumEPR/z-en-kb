# What now?

An untouched storyline was here. I have had high hopes when I first came to UW. Aspired to get into Computer Science, my own incompetence and messed up time management had cost me massive. Mediocre grades with no exceptional experiences, I was not the lucky guy. How many attempt have I made? Was it the only way, acing the introductory courses? Probably not. But would it be worth it to go somewhere other than UW just for the major? I have given up thinking.
