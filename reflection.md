# Reflection

Reflection across a mirror is:
- A depth inversion
- A horizonal 
  - rotation + inversion
- A vertical rotation + inversion

An incoming ray reflects across the surface normal $\mathbf{N}$.

When an incoming ray gets reflected in multiple directions due to surface un-eveness its called specular reflection.

Ways to model specular reflection:
- Measure how a surface reflects light via photography
  - Then fit a [[BRDF]]

Surfaces that reflects light in all direction are called diffused.

For an apple, the redness come from diffused light reflected by pigments, and the highlights come from the wax on the surface.

Combining the diffuse and specular formula to create the material with mixed reflection.
