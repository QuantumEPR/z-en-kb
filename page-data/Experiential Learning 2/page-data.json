It has contributed significantly to my understanding of web development and service design principles. In the past, I often remained in the back and performed assignments on demand, such as I did for my research at the iSchool Gamer Lab. This time, as a full-stack developer, I partake in critical decisions that affect client experiences, such as service usability and stability. During the pandemic, a surge of needs in electronically assisted healthcare arose, and such affordances became critical for health professionals to assess patients' conditions with ease. Aside from generating design choices, I am responsible for their implementation, resolving unexpected behaviors, and leading the team to keep the progress going. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I have demonstrated my efforts in leadership by constantly building a vision of this project for the team and translating such vision into sustained development while working with Brian and various unnamed collaborators. The responsibility of a leader became apparent to me when goals started to get blurry, and there were no specific assignments. I had to take the initiative in establishing measurable objectives, identifying tasks, and setting deadlines for completion. What was especially difficult was maintaining a level of systems thinking as I tend to drift into specific details of an implementation (such as choosing a web framework), which would've disrupted the overall organization of the project. Through extensive self-reminders and communications, I have become more resilient as I learned to notice such potential detours and adjust the scope of goals to keep things on track.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"My training in strategic planning and consistent feedback exchanges have also sharpened my ability to build productive relationships with others.
