For maximizing the usage of the land, and a population of twenty-four million within this city, people ought to explore the possibilities above the ground. If you were to visit a modern Shanghainese home in downtown Shanghai, it would not be odd to find yourself fifteen to thirty floors in the air.

Our apartment had two balconies, one to the south, and the other to the north. They were two different lenses to see the same fantasy. Approaching the south lens, I could clearly see a skyline made of buildings. On the east side of Huangpu River, a futuristic style of skyscrapers carved the land, like metallic bamboos poking out of the ground, thrusting through the clouds. The west side, however, flourished with 1800s European style architecture, ornamented with fabulous arches and details symbolizing the origins of their architects. Was it intentional? Or was it just a beautiful accident? I had no way to tell. Nevertheless, this scene reminded me that people have a history to tell, and a future to endeavor.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Yet this lens was not the one I was interested in. The lens on the northern side, oddly, was I rest my mind upon. Not that because it was any special, but because it was indifferent. Standing on this balcony, you would find yourself surrounded: the other gated community apartments just across the street, and in fact, across any street, piles around so that you could never see the horizon. All that was visible had been limited to a tiny scope of the T-intersection next to our gated community, the small plaza beside the intersection, and the community garden directly below. Why would this view be captivating, you may ask, for this scene seems almost pathetic compared to the grandeur masterpiece presented in the south? My reason would be, you could never experience the reality of the city through the glorified version of the south.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Looking down upon the pedestrians and cyclist on the road, you would realize how insignificant humans seem.

The tissue first fall, but once a breeze had picked it up, it went with the flow, onto a magical journey. Watch, it flew that way! The Zephyr became a tempest, carried the helpless tissue high above, swirling madly in a circle as if the wind has found a partner to waltz. They danced, wiggled across the view, seemed like aiming for the roof of the building twenty meters away, or they were coming back this way, or they were going down\\u2026 The tissue and the air kept performing, hypnotizing me with their unpredictable rhythms. They seemed so liberated. Lifted from the ground, they were never bonded, never escaped. I wished I could be the tissue so that I could go on a mysterious trip passionately, full of wonders and possibilities.

I was trying to nap on the dining table using my arms as pillows, while a few meters away a bunch of Chinese were having a passionate discussion over their vacation plans. Face flat, resting on my arms, I was dozing off. A few words caught my attention: Going back to China. Summer vacation was so close, and since we were graduating this year, it would be sooner, like in two weeks. Of course, I would be going back to China whatsoever because after graduation I would have nowhere to go if not Shanghai, China. I wondered if there was any reason other than that. I had asked these Chinese classmates why would they go back and they looked at me like I was an alien. Cold wind swirled in every time students went outside to be picked up. Still covered in snow, branches wiggled crazily outside the window as wind blew through, like a wave to say goodbye.\\nI never needed to plan for my journey back to Shanghai. I had known the places in Shanghai pretty well so that no assistance would I require to navigate in it. But if it was like my friends asking what I planned to do after I got back, I had no idea.

I had already arrived, and when I finished checking with the officer at the custom, I can already smell the air, the air of Shanghai, which to me is filled with a hypnotizing aroma.

Shanghai was a place where people who didn\\u2019t belong to was more welcomed. People came here for jobs, for a new life, for opportunities, for whatever reasons they found unacceptable in their origins, and they could test themselves out in this experiment ground. Moreover, whoever dominated in the head of the fashion, in all different kinds of fields, got to continue pursuing their lives. Years ago, the small apartments next to our confined neighborhood covered about 5 to 6 blocks of range. Senior people lived in these traditional Chinese apartments. Artisans and small businesses occupied the front fa\\xE7ade. These apartments were not the typical ones you could expect from the US but like the more carefully constructed shanty towns, with tiles colored in dark gray or mahogany, and the shabby, whiteish brick walls. People had been living there, surviving with minimal wages. Now they were gone. Gone from every aspect, the physical structure had been crushed to dust, the landlords and the renters had vanished, just as they had never existed before. The place became a temporary parking lot before the redevelopment. For me, they were gone for good. I believed, that they had reasons to leave. A legitimate reason for themselves, and they should leave no matter what because they really degraded the appearances of the city. Looking at the ashes and gravel, I was pleased.

I spat out the bubbles and foam of the toothpaste, gurgled a bit, and went to the dining table.\\nThe breakfast was quiet, except that my father mentioned whether I had any plan for the day. I shook my head hesitantly, and started to think about the things I could do. Chewing some preserved vegetables with rice porridge, my mind was set to fly; images blinded me like snow. The various screeching sounds of electric scooters, the constant banging from the construction sites, the people on the pedestrian path walk as fast as a race and adults flooding off buses and subways like a dam just had a flood discharge, and the Shanghai Oriental TV Tower radiating different lights piercing through curtains, which I had to get used to again. It was so irritating. The sudden flash of lightning on skyscrapers, followed by the cracking roar of thunder, then the inevitable rain drops was splattering on the ground in weird Prestissimo rhythms, like the sky has pointed a machine gun to this city, shamelessly spraying through the cloud. The sizzling sound of egg frying among the breakfast shops, and the people jaywalking across the street just for their favorite breakfast place.\\nI had known all of these.

A ship docked at the pier, the water of Huangpu River glaring, as if it were liquid sunshine. In an hour, my parents would be back for dinner at this house.
