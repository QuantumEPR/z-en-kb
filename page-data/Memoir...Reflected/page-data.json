Though I had\\nstudied AP English Language and Composition in high school, the rhetorical analysis certainly does not help. So, I started my writing process by doing random flashbacks in my head. Sometimes I lie on the bed, sometimes walking aimlessly, just to bring myself into a tranquil state, where I can dig deep down my well of consciousness, to search for the past and the emotions accompanied it. This process is unbelievably enjoyable: I can be simply wandering in my casual daydreams (which is what I do all the time,) be able to pick up pebbles of forgotten memories and become so relieved as I put these images down into words. Moreover, I do deliberate imitations of the authors we have read, like Tobias Wolff and Michael Ondaatje, and I find their techniques masterful and improve my writings dramatically. It\\u2019s also amazing to see how the themes of \\u201Ctravel\\u201D and \\u201Cmemoir\\u201D fit so well\\nfor me. As an international student who studied high school in the US, I was constantly traveling, to the point of I became a traveler who cannot identify a home anymore.

Both helped me to explore the possibilities within my stories, and by simply talking to them, explaining the convoluted emotions I had kept inside, I found there was much more I could talk about. Backstories were important, and I understood that people did not want to be left disoriented without any clue. Thus, I went a bit further back in time, just to make the beginning more subtle and welcoming, so that the stories were somewhat ordered. Amber told me her knowledge about China due to her boyfriend and suggested me to include characters in my piece. She also recommended me to take in the differences I found between Shanghai and the US. Susan and I had a talk about what could I introduce into the piece, and we discussed incorporating a temple visit, (although never happened in the actual piece). She advised me to bring more background, which I think is something that did make my stories more engaging. Revisions were not that painful. I had some moments where I had the feeling of \\u201CI wrote this, I don\\u2019t want to delete it,\\u201D but when I did press that delete key and reorganized this pile of information, the result flowed pretty well.
