At times, the fear of losing track of the prompt during a presentation would get to my nerves. The last presentation I gave before this quarter was during my Informatics Capstone. It was not even a complete presentation, as I was only responsible for a fraction of it.

A good story does not need excessive texts, but a storyteller who personifies the protagonist (using the four main parts of a story and ABT technique, of course). I am now that storyteller, and I engaged my audience with plot tension, resolution, and appropriate body language. I expressed relevance and invited the listener to an adventure with our protagonist.
