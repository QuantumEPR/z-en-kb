# Talk Persuasively

HONORS 230 was a very demanding yet intellectually challenging course. Professor Roger Soder's *The Language of Leadership* was palatable to read. Many of our classmates were STEM students (and I was yet to be one for real, sad stories.) The class was structured around group discourses, where each of us got to exchange opinions and reflections. Machiavelli's *The Prince* as well as Francis Bacon's writing were particularly tough for me to read. Both of them were immensely thought provoking, however. I've found my way into writing a paper analyzing criteria for leadership and studying incidents from China's contemporary history. The paper was quite long, and the effort I spent during its creation certainly sharpened my understanding of what it takes to lead and the importance of persuasion.
