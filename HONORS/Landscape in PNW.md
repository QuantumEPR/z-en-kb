# Escape

This was my attempt to escape the city into the wild for a while.

The wilderness experience definitely sets a milestone for me, since this is the first time I have endured a 9-day touch of nature, away from the convenience and buzyness of the city. We had mind-expanding discussions. Seeing the perspective of indigenous cultures, radical environmentalism, current issues with protecting species and removing invasive species, the philosophical skepticism over government systems and more, I feel refreshed and more attentive toward the feeling of others. It is our responsibility to create a better, sustainable future for the generations after us. Although I still perceive the current definition of the wilderness a little stereotypically American with some ruggedness, as a fervent techno-optimist I am convinced that I had to take my step upon laying a path of equity and sustainability. After this experience, I have concluded It is not the nature that scares the people, nor is the creatures, but the inability to control and lack of understanding that is driving us to destruction, and we need to fix that starting right now. We can go even further beyond.
